# AUTO_EICAR
EICAR.COM file split into two parts and batch file to auto-construct on Windows desktop, test your Anti-Malware software.  If used in a corporate environment you may want to alert your IT support as it will be a false positive...

Splitting EICAR.COM at the binary level into two parts and then recombining it was the only away I could deploy this test file.  Very useful for off-line checks also.

Within a corporate environment an ISO archive of the contents of this repository would ensure no changes.
